# MoviesPrediction
Our project team is VARS Consulting. NBCUniversal has contracted VARS Consulting to analyze box office performance and make strategic recommendations to assess their companyâ€™s financial performance for upcoming theatrical releases. As part of this consulting engagement we analyzed the box office data for both NBC Universal and other production companies and used it to drive key insights. In this report we detail how we have gathered and prepared the necessary information and satisfied the clients request using a multiple linear regression model. Finally, we use the selected model to predict likely box office outcomes.
